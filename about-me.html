<p class="facts">
<span class="legally">Elle Woods:</span>  [Elle is cross-examining Chutney Windham] Ms. Windham, what had you done earlier that day?
<br>  
<span class="legally">Chutney:</span> I got up. Got a latte. Went to the gym. Got a perm and came home.
<br>
<span class="legally">Elle Woods:</span> Where you got in the shower?
<br>
<span class="legally">Marina R. Bickford:</span>  I believe the witness has made it clear that she was in the shower. [Courtroom audience laughs]
<br>
<span class="legally">Elle Woods:</span>  Yes, your Honor.
<br>
<span class="legally">Elle Woods:</span>  [a sudden brainstorm comes over Elle] Ms. Windham, had you ever gotten a perm before?
<br>
<span class="legally">Chutney:</span>  Yes.
<br>
<span class="legally">Chutney:</span>  Two a year since I was 12. You do the math.
<br>
<span class="legally">Elle Woods:</span>  You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinco got a perm once. We all tried to talk her out of it. Curls weren't a good look for her. She didn't have your bone structure, but thankfully that same day she entered the Pheta Delta Phi wet t-shirt contest where she was completely hosed to down from head to toe...
<br>
<span class="legally">DA Joyce Rafferty: </span>  Objection, why is this relevant?
<br>
<span class="legally">Elle Woods: </span> I have a point, I promise.
<br>
<span class="legally">Marina R. Bickford: </span>  Then make it.
<br>
<span class="legally">Elle Woods: </span>  Chutney, why is it Tracy Marcinco's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
<br>
<span class="legally">Chutney:</span>  Because they got wet.
<br>

</p>

<p class="facts">
<span class="legally">Elle Woods:</span> Exactly. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you're forbidden to wet your hair for at least 24 hours after getting a perm at the risk of deactivating the immonium thygocolate?
   <br>
  <span class="legally">Chutney:</span> She's my age! Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone who was your age?
  <br>
  <span class="legally">Elle Woods: </span> You, <strong>however</strong>, Chutney had time to hide the gun after you shot your father.
  <br>
  <span class="legally">Chutney: </span> [Chutney is in tears] I didn't mean to shoot him! [points at Brooke] I thought it was YOU walking through the door! [Courtroom audience gasps]
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="legally">Elle Woods: </span> Oh my God.
  <br>
  <span class="legally">Marina R. Bickford: </span> Oh my God.
  <br>
  <span class="legally">Brooke Taylor Windham: </span> Oh my God.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="legally">Marina R. Bickford: </span> Balliff, take the witness into custody, where she will be charged for the murder of Joseph Windham. Case dismissed. Mrs. Windham, you're free to go.
  <br>
  <br>
  <span class="legally">Brooke Taylor Windham:</span> Thank you, your honor.
